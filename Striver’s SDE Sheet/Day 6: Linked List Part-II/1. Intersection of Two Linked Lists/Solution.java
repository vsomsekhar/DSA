// ‚úÖ Intuition
// 	‚Ä¢	Use two pointers (dummy1 and dummy2) to traverse both lists.
// 	‚Ä¢	If a pointer reaches the end, switch to the head of the other list.
// 	‚Ä¢	If there‚Äôs an intersection, they will meet at the intersection point.
// 	‚Ä¢	If there‚Äôs no intersection, both will become null at the same time.

// ‚è∞ Time Complexity
// 	‚Ä¢	O(m + n) ‚Üí m and n are the lengths of the two lists.

// ü™¥ Space Complexity
// 	‚Ä¢	O(1) ‚Üí Constant extra space used (only two pointers).
